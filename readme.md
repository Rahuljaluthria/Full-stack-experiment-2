# EXPERIMENT 2 

This is is a Interacive web application which is sub-divided into (exp-2.1, exp-2.2, exp-2.3).
Each experiment demostrates a different of concept of **Javascript interactivity, DOM Manipulation and event handling .**

The entire project is implemented using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** and is hosted as a single website.
